		<h1>Climate change and effects on sea level rising in Santa Cruz</h1>

		<p>For our project, we decided to focus on the subject of sea level rising
      in Santa Cruz. With the increasing temperature of climate change, we hope
      to spread awareness of the issue and propose any potential solutions.
      The project will contain two pages, one a home page and the other an
      interactive page. We intended to open with a brief introduction of the
      purpose of the project and the matters we will be addressing. There will
      be buttons below the title allowing users to navigate to different
      sections. The second page consists of a timeline of rising temperatures
      moving along a vertical line. For each temperature there will be an image
      indicating the state sea levels. Another aspect we hope to execute is
      allowing the user to hover over each image triggering a pop up text adding
      further information. A challenge that we faced as a group is the fact that
      we are working remotely. Although satisfied with our prototype online, we
      feel a digital work setting comes with limits in creativity and
      collaboration. Our next task is to understand the technicalities of
      javascript to fulfil our vision as well as doing further research on
      rising sea levels and how this directly affects Santa Cruz. We plan to
      also find ways to bring our page to life through styling and formatting.
